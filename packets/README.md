This collection of packets will help bootstrap your bootcamp experience by developing a working vocabulary and base set of knowledge around our most commonly used frameworks and technologies in consulting.

Set up your local development environment by following the directions in the *Development-Environment* packet. That will get you primed for the lab, as well as the rest of the packets.
