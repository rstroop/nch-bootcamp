## Introduction
JAX-RS is a powerful specific dealing with creating, producing, and consuming web services. Check out this awesome in-depth [introduction](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giepu.html) from Oracle.

## Labs

There is a JBoss.org [quickstart](http://www.jboss.org/quickstarts/eap/helloworld-rs/) that will show you how to get a web service up and running. Migrating this to OpenShift is optional but recommended. 

Mkyong.com has some great JAX-RS [tutorials](http://www.mkyong.com/tutorials/jax-rs-tutorials/), do the following at a minimum:

1. [RESTEasy hello world example](http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/resteasy-hello-world-example/)
2. [JAX-RS @PathParam example](http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/jax-rs-pathparam-example/)
3. [Download pdf file from JAX-RS](http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/download-pdf-file-from-jax-rs/)
4. [File upload example in RESTEasy] (http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/file-upload-example-in-resteasy/)
5. [JSON example with RESTEasy + Jackson](http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/integrate-jackson-with-resteasy/)
6. [RESTful Java client with Apache HttpClient](http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/restful-java-client-with-apache-httpclient/)
