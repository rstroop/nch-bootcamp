# Setting up your development environment


# Java Development Kit

Across different projects your requirements for Java versions will vary greatly. For the purpose of the bootcamp you will need Java 7:

There are two major implementations of the JDK, a propriatary version from oracle (Oracle JDK) and an open source version (OpenJDK). Installing OpenJDK is simple when using a RHEL/Fedora:

```shell
[selrahal@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install -y java-1.7.0-openjdk
```

To install the Oracle JDK you will need to navigate to their [site] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). For RHEL/Fedora you can download an RPM from oracle and install it using `yum`


# Maven

Maven is a build tool you will use in your project to compile your java code and create you artifacts (jars, ears, wars...). Install it in RHEL/Fedora like so:

```shell
[selrahal@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install -y maven
```

# Git

Git is a source code management tool that is very popular, its largest competitor being Subversion. Install it in RHEL/Fedora like so:

```shell
[selrahal@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install -y git
```

# JBoss Developer Studio (Eclipse)

JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS) is an eclipse based integrated development environment (IDE). It is a very popular IDE that comes with various supported plugins and will be used throughout the bootcamp. In order to download JBDS you will need to have a [Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) account. After downloading the [Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 8.1.0 Stand-alone Installer](https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?downloadType=distributions&product=jbossdeveloperstudio&version=8.1.0) you can start it with

```shell

```

# JBoss EAP

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application server. It provides many services as a runtime for Java applications. In order to download JBoss EAP you will need to have a [Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) account.

# JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.0

In order to download JBoss BPMS you will need to have a [Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) account. If you have an existing installation of EAP you can copy the whole `jboss-eap-6.4` folder to a new folder, called `bpms` and then execute the installer with:
